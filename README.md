# fiZeroBond
A zero coupon bond is a bond that doesnâ€™t pay interest/coupon but instead pays one lump sum face value at maturity. Investors buy zero coupon bonds at a deep discount from their face value. A zero coupon bond generates gains from the difference between the purchase price and the face value while a coupon bond produces gains from the regular distribution of coupon/interest.
